# getirsu-challenge
implementation of getirsu challenge


a gurobi implementation of a VRP formulation

the optimal solution has been achieved for seven orders by using three vehicles which have unlimited capacity.
Optimal objective value: 3794.0
{'0': [0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 5], '1': [1, 9], '2': [2, 6]}
the values are for the order's locations ids

the model can be easily used for the subsets of the vehicles for example by using the vehicles which are located in location 0 and 2.
